            Our family running knitting factories had started its journey in 2019 with few machines only. We had a small stake there and grew with a poor industrial growth due unavoidable facts. Over years those production unit became matured in many extent and so as technical team as well. We then been working with mostly USA and EC based customer.  In 2020 , we have started a small trading house BEAUMONDE DHAKA  , expanded marketing unit of our own decade old factories in Chittagong-Bangladesh. This unit had introduced few retailers and importers with factories on that time. As demand started to grew for some other products from same customer , so we had to consider to reshuffle products line in little broad extent  to support those existing potential customer. Now a days we see that needs for certain products ( ie: Leather, Footwear etc.) is growing so we had to develop string supply chain here.
